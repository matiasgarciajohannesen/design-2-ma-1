                <p>Feminist women love Eminem. "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.</p>

                <p>I've created a monster, â€˜cause nobody wants to. See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya. A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital.</p>
